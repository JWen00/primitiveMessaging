A good place to start would be to: 

* [x] implement the functionality to allow a single user to login with the server. 
* [x] Next, add the blocking functionality for 3 unsuccessful attempts. 
* [x] You could then proceed to the timeout functionality (i.e. automatically logout a user after inactivity. 
* [ ] Then extend this to handle multiple clients.
* [ ] Once your server can support multiple clients, implement the functions for presence notification, whoelse and whoelsesince.
* [ ] Your next milestone should be to implement messaging between users. 
* [ ] Start with broadcast, then move to online messaging and finally offline messaging. 
* [ ] Once you have ensured that all of the above are working perfectly, add the blacklist functionality. 
* [ ] Note that, this will require changing the implementation of some of the functionality that you have already implemented.  
* [ ] Once messaging via the server is working perfectly, you can move on to peer-to-peer messaging. 
* [ ] It is imperative that you rigorously test your code to ensure that all possible (and logical) interactions can be correctly executed
